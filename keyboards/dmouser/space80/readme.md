## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Bridge the two pins vertically underneath the spacebar. Note, there are two sets, since there are two sockets for various spacebar sizes.
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
